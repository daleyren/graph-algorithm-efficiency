# messing around with Erdos–Rényi random graph models

There are two main models for randomized graphs, both called Erdos–Rényi random graph model (terrible naming...would love a little distinction but what can ya do). The first model, denoted G(n, p), creates a graph of n vertices where each edge. The second model, denoted G(n, M), creates a graph of n vertices with exactly M edges ~ the probability that any edge is chose is 1 / (N choose M) where N is the number of edges in a complete graph of n vertices: (n choose 2).

Primarily, these models are through about within undirected frameworks. The goal of this repository is to fuck around with these models outside of this framework and delve into the probabilitstic efficiency of various famous algorithms on these graphs. 

Once I have a better understanding of Percolation theory, I plan to come back and explore other ideas.

using random connectivity for layers within a neural net?
